Mean Reversion Trading Strategy:
	Assumption: Prices tend to “revert” back toward their average after deviating too much.
	The strategy uses Bollinger Bands as the tool:
		SMA (Simple Moving Average): the rolling average of the last N closes (default 20).
		StdDev (Standard Deviation): the volatility measure for that same window
		Upper Band: SMA + (num_std × StdDev).
		Lower Band: SMA – (num_std × StdDev).
		These bands show the “normal range” of price movement around the average.
	The Trading Signals:
	Buy (long): when the closing price drops below the lower band
	→ asset is considered “oversold” → expect a bounce upward.
	Sell (short): when the closing price rises above the upper band
	→ asset is considered “overbought” → expect a drop downward.
	Flat (0): when the price is between the bands → no trade.
	In short: this strategy tries to buy dips (below the lower band) and sell rallies (above the upper band), betting that prices will snap back toward their moving average.
	
Statistical Arbitrage (Pairs Trading)
	Assumption: Two assets that move together (cointegration) can diverge temporarily. The strategy bets that the spread will revert back to its mean.
		Spread construction: Run a rolling regression Asset1 ~ Asset2 to estimate hedge ratio (alpha + beta). Spread = Asset1 – (alpha + beta × Asset2).
		Z-score: Normalize the spread by its rolling mean and std to measure how “far” it is from equilibrium.
		Trading rules:
		Enter long spread (buy Asset1, short Asset2) when Z ≤ –entry threshold.
		Enter short spread (short Asset1, long Asset2) when Z ≥ +entry threshold.
		Exit when |Z| ≤ exit threshold (spread mean-reverts) or after max holding time.
		Execution: Signals are acted on the next bar (to avoid look-ahead).
	Returns: Strategy PnL = position × (r_y – β × r_x).
	Strengths: Works when assets are truly cointegrated, robust in sideways markets.
	Weaknesses: Fails if the relationship breaks down (structural divergence).
	
Trend-Following (MA Crossover)
	Assumption: Capture persistent price trends by comparing short-term momentum with long-term direction.
	Signal engine:
		Compute two moving averages (short vs long).
		Golden Cross: short MA crosses above long MA → go long.
		Death Cross: short MA crosses below long MA → exit (or go short if enabled).
		Execution: Enter/exit on the next bar to avoid look-ahead bias.
		Return calculation: Strategy return = position × market return. Costs deducted when position changes.
	Strengths: Simple, robust, and effective in trending markets.
	Weaknesses: Lags on trend reversals, suffers whipsaws in sideways markets, sensitive to parameters.
	SMA vs EMA:
	SMA = smoother, slower response, fewer trades.
	EMA = faster response, earlier entries/exits, but noisier.	
	
Market Making (Quote & Fill Simulation)
	Assumption: Continuously post bid/ask quotes around the mid price to buy low (bid) and sell high (ask), profiting from the spread while managing inventory risk.
	Quoting:
	Base half-spread = spread_bps / 1e4.
	Optional inventory skew shifts the quoting mid when you’re long/short to encourage rebalancing (sell more when long, buy more when short).
	Fills:
		A buy occurs if the current mid ≤ previous bar’s bid quote.
		A sell occurs if the current mid ≥ previous bar’s ask quote.
		Optional setting allows both sides to fill in the same bar.
		Risk control: Hard inventory limits (±limit). Quotes skew with inventory to reduce carry risk.
	PnL:
		Cash updated on fills (price × qty ± fees/rebates).
		Equity = cash + inventory × mid (mark-to-market).
		Fees modeled per leg via maker_fee_bps (negative → rebate).
	Metrics: number of trades, turnover, peak inventory usage, final equity, final inventory.
	Strengths: Simple, transparent, highlights spread capture and inventory dynamics.
	Weaknesses: Ignores queue position/partial fills, latency, tick size, adverse selection; sensitive to spread and fee assumptions.
